### Make a user an admin

votey-uppy has a very basic role based system. There's only two roles: no role and admin.

To make a user an admin you need to run the following MongoDB queries:

```sh
# Connect to voteyUppy database
mongo voteyUppy

# Find the ObjectId of the user
db.users.find({ username: 'USERNAME_HERE' });

# Set the user's role
db.users.updateOne({_id: ObjectId("OBJECT_ID_HERE")}, { $set: { role: 'admin' }})

# (Optional) Remove the user's role
db.users.updateOne({_id: ObjectId("OBJECT_ID_HERE")}, { $unset: { role: '' }})
```
